# Khaxa
Your own link saver, done right.

:warning: **Currently under active development. Not yet ready for everyday use.** :warning:

## Features
- Save web links for later and access them everywhere.
- Syncs in real time among devices (works offline too).
- Always organized (tags, groups, categories, sites) to easily find them in the future.
- Privacy in mind: you own your data (as much as possible, currently the only supported storage provider is google's firebase).
- [Free (as in freedom)](#license): you can always adapt it to your own needs and share it with friends and the world!

## Backlog
- Frees browser memory (Khaxa extension for FF mobile and Chromium-based desktop browsers).
- Automatic tagging.
- Persistence layer adapter options so the final user can choose where to store her data.
- Don't save just the link, but actually download the content (where possible and makes sense).
- API to allow third party interactions (bots, extensions, apps).
- Powerful use for selections (result of a query, filter):
  - Download as ebook.
  - Share on internet.
- Collaborative and social approach.
- Automatic updates.
